                <h3>Red Giant</h3>
                <p>Red giants are large stars in the late stages of their evolution. They have expanded after burning through their hydrogen fuel.</p>

        <h2>The Life Cycle of a Star</h2>
        <p>Stars are born from clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae. Over millions of years, they go through several stages, including main sequence, red giant, and eventually, death as a white dwarf or neutron star. Some of the most massive stars end their lives in spectacular supernova explosions, leaving behind black holes or neutron stars.</p>

        <h2>Fascinating Facts About Stars</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The nearest star to Earth is the Sun, about 93 million miles away.</li>
            <li>Stars can be as small as 20 kilometers (neutron stars) or as large as over 1,000 times the size of the Sun (supergiants).</li>
            <li>Stars shine because of nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing vast amounts of energy.</li>
            <li>The hottest stars, called blue stars, can reach temperatures over 30,000°C, while the coolest, red dwarfs, are about 2,500°C.</li>
