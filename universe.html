        <h2>What is the Universe?</h2>
        <p>
            The universe is everything that exists, including all matter, energy, planets, stars, galaxies, and even space and time. 
            It has been expanding since its beginning, around 13.8 billion years ago, in an event known as the Big Bang.
        </p>
        <h2>The Structure of the Universe</h2>
        <p>
            The universe is made up of billions of galaxies, each containing millions or billions of stars, planets, and other celestial objects.
            Galaxies are held together by gravity and are spread out over vast distances. In between galaxies, there is vast emptiness, known as intergalactic space.
        </p>
        <h2>Dark Matter and Dark Energy</h2>
        <p>
            Interestingly, only a small fraction of the universe is made of ordinary matter, like the stars and planets we see. Most of the universe is composed of 
            mysterious substances called dark matter and dark energy, which scientists are still trying to understand.
